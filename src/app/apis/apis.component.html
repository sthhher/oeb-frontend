    <h3>OpenEBench public API's</h3>
    <p>
        Although the OpenEBench website gives access to all information stored
        in the data warehouse in a friendly manner, the platform is designed to
        provide information in a way that can be integrated in other
        infrastructures. To this end a series of RESTful APIâ€™s have been
        developed. Information from these APIs is obtained in JSON format.
